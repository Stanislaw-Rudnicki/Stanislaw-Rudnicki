My name is Stanislav, and I'm a switcher.<br>
From 2019 to 2022, I studied at the [STEP Computer Academy](https://itstep.org/en), majoring in Software Development.
Now I live in Spain, and I'm looking for a job as a Junior software developer.
Before that, I worked for 12 years as a translator of Polish - Ukrainian - Russian languages. And also as a teacher of the Polish language.
