My name is Stanislav, and I'm a switcher.<br>
From 2019 to 2022, I studied at the [STEP Computer Academy](https://itstep.org/en), majoring in Software Development.<br>
Because of the war in Ukraine, I had to move to Marbella, Spain.<br>
I'm looking for a job as a Junior software developer.<br>
Before that, I worked for 12 years as a translator of Polish - Ukrainian - Russian languages.<br>
And also as a teacher of the Polish language.
